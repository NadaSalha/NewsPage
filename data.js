   fullContent: "A War Within a War rom the very first day of the war, another hidden war was being waged — a war against the medical staff and hospitals in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north. As the fighting initially focused on northern Gaza, medical professionals were forcibly displaced to the south, leaving the north almost entirely devoid of specialists or expertise. The collapse deepened with the severe shortage of medical supplies, worsening the suffering of both healthcare workers and the wounded.On that first day, several hospitals shut down, including Beit Hanoun Hospital, which housed surgical, internal medicine, and pediatric departments, and Al-Durra Children’s Hospital. This forced the population to converge on just two hospitals: the Indonesian Hospital and Kamal Adwan.The real struggle began as civilians sought shelter inside hospitals. At one point, it became physically impossible to walk through the corridors due to overcrowding. For the first three months, medical teams remained in the hospitals for days, even weeks, without seeing their families. Often, they only heard news of their loved ones from others — or worse, saw them arrive at the hospital wrapped in shrouds, injured, or dismembered.No Communication, No RescueDuring these early months, the Israeli military deliberately cut off communication and internet access in northern Gaza, paralyzing the efforts of ambulances and civil defense teams to locate or respond to bombings.The only way to learn of attacks was when neighbors carried the injured or dead themselves — using private vehicles, donkeys, or horses — and reported the location to emergency responders.One night in November 2023, heavy shelling began at midnight. With no means of communication, no one knew where the strike had hit. By sunrise, we discovered it had been the UNRWA-run Al-Fakhoura School. Casualties poured in — some already dead, others fatally wounded.I remember standing with a colleague in front of four children with severed limbs. He told me, “Pick one to try to save.” We had to choose who lived and who died. Among the dead was the father of a nurse who worked with us at reception.That was our nightly routine: not knowing the strike location until the morning, triaging the dying, and saving only the few we could.Makeshift Medicine By the end of November, Israeli forces had reached Kamal Adwan Hospital. With the Indonesian Hospital shut down, all medical services in the north converged there. The army besieged and stormed Kamal Adwan, arresting medical staff and forcing them south. They executed some of the displaced and detained others. The hospital was shut down. Al-Shifa Hospital was out of service, and the Baptist Hospital was under siege.That left just one functional facility in all of northern Gaza: a small clinic named Beit Al-Kheir.Beit Al-Kheir was never equipped to handle emergencies — not even close. Yet we tried to transform it to offer any kind of care.",

   fullContent: "A War Within a War rom the very first day of the war, another hidden war was being waged — a war against the medical staff and hospitals in the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north. As the fighting initially focused on northern Gaza, medical professionals were forcibly displaced to the south, leaving the north almost entirely devoid of specialists or expertise. The collapse deepened with the severe shortage of medical supplies, worsening the suffering of both healthcare workers and the wounded.On that first day, several hospitals shut down, including Beit Hanoun Hospital, which housed surgical, internal medicine, and pediatric departments, and Al-Durra Children’s Hospital. This forced the population to converge on just two hospitals: the Indonesian Hospital and Kamal Adwan.The real struggle began as civilians sought shelter inside hospitals. At one point, it became physically impossible to walk through the corridors due to overcrowding. For the first three months, medical teams remained in the hospitals for days, even weeks, without seeing their families. Often, they only heard news of their loved ones from others — or worse, saw them arrive at the hospital wrapped in shrouds, injured, or dismembered.No Communication, No RescueDuring these early months, the Israeli military deliberately cut off communication and internet access in northern Gaza, paralyzing the efforts of ambulances and civil defense teams to locate or respond to bombings.The only way to learn of attacks was when neighbors carried the injured or dead themselves — using private vehicles, donkeys, or horses — and reported the location to emergency responders.One night in November 2023, heavy shelling began at midnight. With no means of communication, no one knew where the strike had hit. By sunrise, we discovered it had been the UNRWA-run Al-Fakhoura School. Casualties poured in — some already dead, others fatally wounded.I remember standing with a colleague in front of four children with severed limbs. He told me, “Pick one to try to save.” We had to choose who lived and who died. Among the dead was the father of a nurse who worked with us at reception.That was our nightly routine: not knowing the strike location until the morning, triaging the dying, and saving only the few we could.Makeshift Medicine By the end of November, Israeli forces had reached Kamal Adwan Hospital. With the Indonesian Hospital shut down, all medical services in the north converged there. The army besieged and stormed Kamal Adwan, arresting medical staff and forcing them south. They executed some of the displaced and detained others. The hospital was shut down. Al-Shifa Hospital was out of service, and the Baptist Hospital was under siege.That left just one functional facility in all of northern Gaza: a small clinic named Beit Al-Kheir.Beit Al-Kheir was never equipped to handle emergencies — not even close. Yet we tried to transform it to offer any kind of care.",
